This is the OmniTI child of OpenIndiana's pkg(5) child.

Our branching strategy is that we do not alter upstream OI branches.

Additional branches include:

1.) omnios

	This is the default development branch for OmniOS now.  Besides
	ongoing development, this branch may be refreshed with merges from
	the "oi" branch from upstream.  Commits in this branch are able to
	be cherry-picked by any upstream branch that wants 'em.  Just follow
	the CDDL & give credit where due.

2.) r151XXX

	As we issues releases, we will branch for each release.

If you wish to discuss development here, join the discussion at
omnios-discuss at lists dot omniti dot com.
